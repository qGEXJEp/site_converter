**Site Converter** is a Python tool that automatically scans any website, detects all embedded resources (images, videos, fonts, CSS, JS, etc.), downloads them to your computer, and updates all links inside the HTML file so the website can work **completely offline**.

Perfect for archiving, research, or creating backups of static websites. 🌍💾
